### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Adilson. I have been working in web development for a few years, focusing mainly on PHP and the Laravel framework. 

However, last year I decided to learn new technologies such as NodeJS, ReactJS, and React Native. 

Currently, I'm taking the GoStack course at RocketSeat and I'm loving it.
